## Introduction
Spark Type is a speed-testing website that allows users to test their typing speed and accuracy. Users can select the level of difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard) and the time duration (2 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes) for the test. The website presents a passage for the user to type, and the wrong words are not included in the speed calculation. The current typing speed is displayed on the right side of the website screen.
